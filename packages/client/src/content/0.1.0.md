## Not duelyst Version 0.1.0

### Runes revamp

This upates completely overhauls the resources system. As such, most cards have been changed / adjusted. The UI has also been evamped to adapt to those changes. The new resource system reads as follows:

- Cards have a cost in gold and in runes. Runes represent game factions.
- Every turn, you have the choice to either gain one more gold, draw one more card, or increase your score in one of the 5 runes.
- Runes don't get depleted when you play a card. Once you have enough runes to play a card, it will stay like this, barring card effects that could change your runes count.
- In the future, cards abilities could also have some runes requirement to be played.
